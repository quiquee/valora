# Valora

A blockchain-based user rating system.


This documents describes the principles of the system, its rationale, and hints some of its use cases.

## What is Valora
_this is a descriptive section_


A generic, anonymous, autonomous, open, permissionless, decentralized, public and immutable rating system.

1. **Generic**: the system provides functionality for any “thing” that can be described using a unique identifier in a way that can be identified unequivocally.

2. **Anonymous**: the system does not require identification of the users or systems that make use of it.

3. **Open**: anyone can access the system and use it in a simple manner since the system itself will be open source and open to all to change and improve.

4. **Permissionless:** anonymous users can exist, i.e. there is no capacity to block a user from entering the system.

5. **Descentralized:** the system lives in the nodes of a blockchain, so there is no single point of control/failure.

6. **Public:**a nyone or anything can use the system, and in particular ratings are public and available for all.

7. **Immutable:** any data in the system is persistent and cannot be modified or deleted.

8. **Controlled:** there are mechanisms to ensure the system is not spammed or filled with garbage.


## What is Valora for

This system is intended to collect, store and retrieve Ratings which express an opinion on a Thing.
Ratings are submitted by Rating Agents based on the terms of the previous section.

Potential uses cases for this are:
 - storage and retrieval of opinions of any product or service,
 - collection of opinions on any type of proposal (e.g. a new law),
 - analysis of market or sentiment trends,
 - help build a portable reputation identity for anything.

## What Valora is not

- a fact-backed deterministic opinion system (facts could provided to support an opinion, but such facts are not requested in Valora),
- a voting system.

TBD - others

## Why is Valora a worthy system

Non-blockchain-based rating systems have the following flaws:
- a single person or institution can control the rating database and tamper with it,
- the institution in charge of the rating system can disappear,
- access to data is almost always limited for relevant cases, or requires login to access it,
